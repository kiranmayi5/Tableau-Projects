# 🏥 Eli Lilly Clinical Trials Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This **Tableau dashboard** provides insights into **Eli Lilly's clinical trials**, analyzing key trends such as:
- **Trial duration across different phases**
- **Intervention types (Drugs, Biologic, Medical Devices, etc.)**
- **Global distribution of trials by country**
- **Growth trends in drug vs. non-drug trials over time**

This visualization helps in understanding how clinical trials are distributed, how long they take, and which areas of research are most prominent.
